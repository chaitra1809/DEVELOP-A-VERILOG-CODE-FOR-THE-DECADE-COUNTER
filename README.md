# DEVELOP-A-VERILOG-CODE-FOR-THE-DECADE-COUNTER
A decade counter, also known as a mod-10 counter, it is a digital circuit that counts the number of pulses or clock  signals it receives, incrementing its output by one for every ten input pulses. The design of a decade counter  typically involves flip-flops, which are basic memory elements in digital electronics
